Welcome to my site. 
Hope you landed here organically, lol.
Thanks for reading my personal piece of useless thought.
I don't think I have an interesting life story but let me tell you a little bit of my background story.</p><p>I was born in Indonesia and have a very normal life as a kid and teenager.
Have a favorite footbal club (Me? Manchester United), play footbal or futsal like every week if not every 3 days ü§î, play games, considered as a smart kid (and getting more stupid as life progress), etc.
Later I attended college at Universitas Indonesia, one of the elite college in Indonesia.
I live a life of college student as a free-man with no burden, I do what I want as I please.
What happy life, some of it kind a stressful especially college but also excited, yes.</p><p>I graduated from Universitas Indonesia with Information System major. 
Although, I also took many Computer Science courses and got some proper experience as Software Engineer intern in one of e-commerce company. 
I take both major courses back in the college including Software Engineering, Distributed System, Human-Computer Interaction, Project Management, etc.</p><p>Later at my final year of college, I decide to join my friends to building a startup.
Before that moment I don't think I will straight into buiding a startup right after college.
But I was so excited with the idea and the team, 
I think I will rarely get this excitement later.</p><p>So here I am, working together with my friends at our startup Bahasa.ai. 
We are working on conversational chatbot for transactional purpose via WhatsApp for Indonesian citizen. 
We are very excited to help less digital-savvy people to have access to digital service, especially commerce and financial service, via WhatsApp.
Wish us luck ‚úå.</p><p>That's it.
A piece of story of my life.
Enjoy your stay here.
