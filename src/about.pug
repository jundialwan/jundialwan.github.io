    | Hi, I'm Jundi. Welcome to my site. 
    | Hope you landed here organically, lol.
    | Thanks for reading my personal piece of useless thought.
    | I don't think I have an interesting life story but let me tell you a little bit of my background story.
  p
    | I was born in Indonesia and have a very normal life as a kid and teenager.
    | Have a favorite footbal club (Me? Manchester United), play footbal or futsal like every week if not every 3 days ü§î, play games (read: Winning Eleven or FIFA), considered as a smart kid (and getting more stupid as life progress), etc.
    | Later I attended college at Universitas Indonesia, one of the elite college in Indonesia.
    | I live a life of college student as a free-man with no burden, I do what I want as I please.
    | What happy life, some of it kind a stressful especially college but also excited, yes.
  p
    | I graduated from Universitas Indonesia with Information System major. 
    | Although, I also took many Computer Science courses and got some proper experience as Software Engineer intern in one of e-commerce company. 
    | I take both major courses back in the college including Software Engineering, Distributed System, Human-Computer Interaction, Project Management, etc.
  p
    | Later at my final year of college, I decide to join my friends to building a startup.
    | Before that moment I don't think I will straight into buiding a startup right after college.
    | But I was so excited with the idea and the team, 
    | I think I will rarely get this excitement later.
    | I was started ad Front-end engineer here then Software Engineer and now being Head of Product year later.
    | Very excited moment as you find how interesting building a startup, get a funding, and changing mindset.
    | Trust me you might be familiar with the principle or mindset of building a startup but you will really feel it when you do it. 
  p
    | So here I am, working together with my friends at our startup Bahasa.ai. 
    | We are working on conversational chatbot for transactional purpose via WhatsApp for Indonesian citizen. 
    | We are very excited to help less digital-savvy people to have access to digital service, especially commerce and financial service, via WhatsApp.
    | Wish us luck ‚úå.
  p
    | That's it.
    | A piece of story of my life.
    | Enjoy your stay here.
