> **Run Alone You'll Run Fast, Run Together You'll Run Far**

That's one of my favorite quote/proverb. It's a Zambian proverb. I'm not sure where and when did I first caught that proverb but it really hits me close to home.

I was misunderstanding this proverb. I thought that it is your choice that you run alone or run together. It is a choice indeed but the proverb itself not telling you to choose one over the other. 

It's telling you that indeed you could run fast alone but see what you can achieve with your beloved ones in slower pace. You'll run far, you achieve more by running slower but together. 

It doesn't mean more distance you travel, but all the moments you share with others.

I always trying to run alone, it seems faster. But I don't know if I can maintain this fast speed forever alone without no one around.

I later realize that it is actually possible to still run fast together. I suppose, you need to find someone that share the same value and mindset. 

I'm still a work in progress at this very matter.
